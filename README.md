# Team 14 - Recipe Website Project

### How to use the website:
First of all, non logged-in users will come to an index interface, where there are recipes uploaded by people before. Click the orange title of the recipe to jump to the details of these recipes. You can also search the menu you want with keywords, such as "pizza". The software also allows you to arrange recipes in a certain order, including chronological order from new to old, positive or reverse alphabetic order. The user can also select login account or registered account. Click login account, the user can enter his user name and password. The system will jump to the profile interface. In this interface, you can change your personal information, including birthday, gender and country (non required items). You can also upload your favorite avatar, preferably a square picture, otherwise the proportion will be distorted. If you haven't uploaded your avatar, the system will give you a default avatar, which is also a link to your profile interface. You can also click post to write your own recipe, including a title and text section. Logged-in users with different identities will see different navigation bars. The navigation bar of non logged-in users does not log out, profile and post. The navigation bar of logged-in users does not login and register, which is convenient for users.

### Overall Description:
The website allows registered users to create a recipe for a dish. The user can be able to specify ingredients required for a dish, and also upload photos/images about the dish. The user can be able to categorise the recipe (e.g., Italian, French, Chinese, Indian, Irish, etc.) and then search for recipes matching a particular category. The user can be able to create their categories themselves, i.e., one user may create categories about Chinese dishes, and another user may create categories about Italian dishes, etc. A user can be able to categorise their recipes only by the categories they have created. An unregistered user can be able to only view recipes, by selecting all the categories available in the system.
